				Summary
			</a></h2>
			<p>
				This is a personal project which uses a Leaflet map to display ocean water test results provided by the <a href=https://countyofsb.org/phd/oceanwatermonitoring/>Santa Barbara County Public Health Department’s Ocean Water Monitoring Program</a>. The county tests beaches at least weekly and may issue warnings or close beaches if targeted bacterial counts exceed state standards. These targeted bacterial groups are indicators of fecal water contamination and elevated levels beyond state standards may present health hazards to ocean users. If a beach exceeds the standards, warnings will be posted or the beach will be closed then re-sampled at intervals until it is within acceptable standards and restrictions can be lifted.
			</p>
			<p>
				Water quality reports are posted as PDFs to the <a href=https://www.countyofsb.org/phd/oceanwatermonitoring/>Ocean Water Monitoring page</a> at least once a week. However, initial reports often lack beach data and beaches may need to be re-sampled, this means that amended PDFs are often released throughout the week. Test result data are not otherwise accessible on the internet. I saw this as an opportunity to expand my Python, database management, and web design skills. I designed a workflow and web map to display these data in an easily usable and mobile friendly format. Report PDFs are downloaded, test result details are extracted, and data are inserted into a Postgres database. These data are then served to a Leaflet map which displays the most recent test results.

			<h3><a href=#PDF-processing>PDF Processing</a></h3>
				<p>
				Here is an example of a standard PDF ocean water quality report with all beaches filled in:
				<div class="centered-imgs">
					<a href="{{ url_for('projectPages_BP.static', filename='project-SBC-Water-Quality/icons_images/PDF_Ex_Filled_In_Comp.PNG') }}" target="_blank">
						<img src="{{ url_for('projectPages_BP.static', filename='project-SBC-Water-Quality/icons_images/PDF_Ex_Filled_In_Comp.PNG') }}" style="box-shadow: 5px 6px 8px #888;border-radius:10px;">
					</a>
				</div>
				</p>
				<p>
					Since reports are released weekly, with possible amendments throughout the week, and the PDF report download URL is static, the PDFs need to be downloaded and processed daily. Rather than figuring out how to setup a Linux based cron job, I found it easier to schedule daily processing using the Python <a href=https://apscheduler.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>APScheduler</a> library. Since most reports are available by 8 am, the following code kicks off daily PDF downloading and processing at 16:30 UTC, 8:30 am PST:
				</p>
				<p>
					<pre><code>
from apscheduler.schedulers.background import BackgroundScheduler
from pytz import utc
sched = BackgroundScheduler(daemon=True, timezone=utc)
sched.add_job(pdfjob, trigger='cron', hour='16', minute='30')
sched.start()
					</pre></code>
				</p>
				<p>
					To begin parsing a report PDF, first it needs to be downloaded from the County's website. This is a relatively simple task since the County’s test result PDF download URL is static and hasn't changed since I began this project. First the PDF is downloaded to a local drive with a meaningful name:
				</p>
				<p>
					<pre><code>
pdfName = f"Ocean_Water_Quality_Report_{datetime.now().strftime('%Y%m%d')}.pdf"
pdfLoc = pdfDest = os.path.join(app.root_path, 'static', 'documents', 'Water_Qual_PDFs', pdfName)
downloadURL = "http://countyofsb.org/uploadedFiles/phd/PROGRAMS/EHS/Ocean%20Water%20Weekly%20Results.pdf"
# Kick off script by downloading PDF
urlretrieve(downloadURL, pdfDest)
					</pre></code>
				</p>
				<p>
					Extracting PDF contents was a bit of a challenge. The PDFs are machine generated, i.e. exported from a Word Document, so OCR isn’t needed, but I had a hard time finding a python library that extracted the contents correctly. After trying a couple libraries, I came across the <a href=https://www.github.com/jsvine/pdfplumber>pdfplumber</a> library that not only extracted the contents well, but also had the ability to detect and pull out the data table content as a separate object.
				</p>
					This function extracts the contents of the PDF, passes them into a function to clean text (shown afterwards) and returns a dictionary containing the information:
				<p>
					<pre><code>
def getPDFContents(pdfLoc):
	"""
	Extracts contents of PDF, including date and table information, and formats data by normalizing Unicode data and
	removing extra characters.

	:param pdfLoc: String. Location of local PDF file.
	:return: Dict:
	    ['text']: Original raw text of PDF
	    ['tab']: Raw table extracted from PDF
	    ['pdfDate']: Date from PDF converted to the following format: {full month name} {numeric day} {full year}
	    ['cleanedtext']: list of values from table, each row is a nested list containing normalized values
	"""
	pdfDict = {}
	# Open pdf and extract content
	with pdfplumber.open(pdfLoc) as pdf:
	    p1 = pdf.pages[0]
	    pdfDict['text'] = p1.extract_text()
	    raw_tab = p1.extract_tables()[0]
	    pdfDict['tab'] = raw_tab

	# Extract date from title and create a list of values
	pdfTitleList = pdfDict['text'].split("Sample Results for the Week of: ")[1].split(" ")
	# Pull the first 3 values from list, these are the date values
	dirtyTitle = f"{pdfTitleList[0]} {pdfTitleList[1]} {pdfTitleList[2]}"
	# Normalize and remove extra characters
	pdfDate = cleanText([dirtyTitle])[0]
	# Convert to string time
	pdfDict['pdfDate'] = datetime.strptime(pdfDate, '%B %d %Y')
	cleanedtext = []
	# Normalize the data within the raw table, each row is a nested list
	for beachdetails in raw_tab:
	    cleanedtext.append(cleanText(beachdetails))
	pdfDict['cleanedtext'] = cleanedtext
	return pdfDict
					</pre></code>
				</p>
				<p>
					This function cleans the raw date and table contents so they can be parsed in a consistent matter. The <a href=https://www.docs.python.org/3/library/unicodedata.html#unicodedata.normalize>normalization function</a> was required to address Unicode issues I was encountering, such as regular and non-breaking spaces causing equality checks to fail.
				</p>
				<p>
					<pre><code>
	def cleanText(textList):
		"""
	  Normalizes the unicode text within the provided list, this is needed since the PDF conversion to text leads to
	  some Unicode characters being a combination of two Unicode characters, where we want a single value for ease of use.

	  formatting are removed. This ensures that data can be cleanly inserted into Postgres with consistent values.

	  :param textList: Nested list of values to be cleaned.
	  :return: Nested list of cleaned values
	  """
	  text = []
		for item in textList:
	      if not item:
	          # Captures None types and skips
	          pass
	      elif item == '':
	          item = None
	      elif item == "&lt;10":
	          item = "0"
	      elif "&gt;" in item:
	          item = item.replace("&gt;","")
	      elif item is not None:
	          item = unicodedata.normalize("NFKD", item).replace("\n", "").replace("‐", "-").replace(",", "")
	          if item == 'Results not available':
	              item = None
	      text.append(item)
		return text
					</pre></code>
				</p>
				<p>
					Now that the PDF date and contents have been extracted they can be used to check if the PDF has been processed before, if the PDF is the first report the week, or if the PDF contains data amendments. This is first done by calculating the MD5 hash of the PDF's contents:
				</p>
				<p>
					<pre><code>
import hashlib
Hash text of pdf document, I believe encode is required for the hashing to work properly
hashedText = hashlib.md5(pdfDict['text'].encode()).hexdigest()
					</pre></code>
				</p>
				<p>
				Next the MD5 hash and pdfDates are checked against the database to determine the status of the downloaded PDF:
				</p>
				<p>
					<pre><code>
def checkmd5(hash, pdfDate):
  """
  Checks if the downloaded PDF's MD5 hash is already in Postgres and returns result.

  :param hash: String
      New MD5 hash
  :param pdfDate: String
      New PDF Date
  :return: String
      "Exists" - Hash is already in Postgres
      "New" - Hash is not in Postgres and no other hashes exist for the PDF result week
      "Update" - Hash is not in Postgres but other hashes exist for the PDF result week
  """
  # Query Postgres with pdfDate of newly downloaded PDF
  session = Session()
  query = session.query(waterQualityMD5).filter(waterQualityMD5.pdfdate == pdfDate).all()
  hashList = []

      hashList.append(i.md5)
  session.close()
  if hash in hashList:
      return "Exists"
  elif len(hashList) == 0:
      return "New"
  else:
      return "Update"
					</pre></code>
				</p>
				<p>
					The PDF's status is used to determine what to do next, if the PDF's hash is already in the database then the script quits, if the PDF is new then the contents are extracted, and if the PDF is an update amendment then just the new records are extracted:
				</p>
				<p>
					<pre><code>

					Now that the data are extracted and processed, they need to be stored. I had already built a Postgres/PostGIS database on AWS RDS for my <a href=/projects/livetrackingdashboard>Mobile Livetracker</a> so I expanded it to include these data.

			<h3><a href=#storing-pdfs>Storing PDF Reports</a></h3>
			<p>
				Since the server is processing the PDFs, I needed an easy way to store and review PDFs that didn't involve connecting directly to the server through SSH. During development and testing I was storing PDFs in a Google Drive File Stream folder. I decided to continue storing PDFs in this folder from the server using the Google Drive API.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Python library <a href=https://pythonhosted.org/PyDrive/>PyDrive</a> simplified this process greatly. To authenticate  the application and grant access to my Google Drive account using OAuth2.0, I followed the PyDrive guide <a href=https://pythonhosted.org/PyDrive/quickstart.html>here</a> on a localhost version of the application. However, instead of using the local web server method, I used command line authentication. I did this in case I ever need to re-authenticate my application on the web server instead of on localhost. I am not sure if that will ever be required since it appears that authentication and granting of access only needs to occur once, even if its on localhost, as long as the correct settings are used and the credentials file/details are accessible by the application.
			</p>
			<p>
				Code to authenticate with Google Drive API, establish connection to API, and to upload a PDF to a specific folder using its ID:
				<pre><code>
from pydrive.auth import GoogleAuth
from pydrive.drive import GoogleDrive
# Change default location for client_secrets.json
GoogleAuth.DEFAULT_SETTINGS['client_config_file'] = os.path.join(app.root_path, 'credentials.json')
# Create authenticated GoogleDrive instance using settings from the setting.yaml file to auto-authenticate with saved
# credentials
gauth = GoogleAuth(settings_file=os.path.join(app.root_path, 'settings.yaml'))
# Establish connection with Google Drive API
drive = GoogleDrive(gauth)
# Create a new GoogleDriveFile instance with a PDF mimetype in the water quality PDF folder using the parent folder's ID
newfile = drive.CreateFile({"title": pdfname,
                            'mimeType': 'application/pdf',
                            'parents': [{'id': "1GRunRWB7SKmH3I0wWbtyJ_UOCDiHGAxO"}]})
# Read file and set the content of the new file instance
newfile.SetContentFile(pdfloc)
# Upload the file to Google Drive
newfile.Upload()
			</code></pre>
			</p>
			<p>
				To enable auto-authentication on a remote machine I used the <a href = https://pythonhosted.org/PyDrive/oauth.html>setting.yaml remote method</a> with the following settings:
<pre><code>
client_config_backend: settings
client_config:
  client_id: [ID]
  client_secret: [Secret]
save_credentials: True
save_credentials_backend: file
save_credentials_file: application/credentials.json

get_refresh_token: True

oauth_scope:
  - https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive
</code></pre>
			</p>
			<p>
				Storing the files in my Google Drive account is primarily for QAQCing any issues with the application and to retain records since the County doesn't provide historic reports on its website. These PDFs are not publicly available, however in the future I would like to expand this web application and work with AWS S3 Buckets to serve out these historic reports as downloadable files.

			<h3><a href=#serving-data-leafet>Serving up Data for Leaflet</a></h3>
				<p>
				Now it’s time to query that data I worked so hard to get into the database. For simplicity, I decided to serve out just the most recent results for each beach. Flask templates and expressions are used to pass the data into the HTML document to be accessed by JavaScript and Leaflet. This process provided me with major two hurdles, querying and accessing data from
				related records and getting the data into proper GeoJSON format for Leaflet. I had a hard time finding solid examples of how to setup SQLAlchemy models for foreign key relationships and how to query and extract information from them. Fortunately, this <a href=https://www.stackoverflow.com/questions/44069023/sqlalchemy-show-only-latest-result-if-a-join-returns-multiple-results>post</a> contained example code on how to query the newest record per beach based on data from related tables.
				</p>
				<p>
					Python function to get the most recent water quality results per beach:
					<pre><code class="python">
records = session.query(waterQuality, waterQualityMD5, beaches, \
		sqlfunc.ST_GeometryType(beaches.geom), sqlfunc.st_x(beaches.geom), \
		sqlfunc.st_y(beaches.geom)) \
    .join(waterQualityMD5) \
    .join(beaches) \
    .distinct(waterQuality.beach_id)\
    .order_by(waterQuality.beach_id,  waterQualityMD5.insdate.desc()).all()
					</code></pre>
				</p>
				<p>
				Working with GeoJSON data was difficult, as I wanted to avoid manually formatting the structure of the data. While I had a method developed for my Livetracker, I wanted a more direct
				method for generating feature collections. Fortunately the <a href=https://www.pypi.org/project/geojson/ rel="external">GeoJSON</a> library worked perfectly and had solid example code. Working with the
				well-known binary (WKB) representation of coordinates, provided when using select queries against PostgreSQL/PostGIS, was also challenging. However, the
				<a href=https://www.geoalchemy-2.readthedocs.io/en/latest/> Geo-Alchemy2</a> library contains PostGIS query functions to query coordinates directly, avoiding the need to convert text from binary.
				</p>
				<p>
					Python function to generate a Feature Collection result:
				<div><pre><code class="python">
resultDict = {}
for i, item in enumerate(records):
	beachname = (item.waterQuality.beach_rel.BeachName)
	resultDict[beachname] = {}
	resultDict[beachname]['FecColi'] = item.waterQuality.FecColi
	resultDict[beachname]['TotColi'] = item.waterQuality.TotColi
	resultDict[beachname]['Entero'] = item.waterQuality.Entero
	resultDict[beachname]['ExceedsRatio'] = item.waterQuality.ExceedsRatio
	resultDict[beachname]['BeachStatus'] = (item.waterQuality.BeachStatus).rstrip()
	resultDict[beachname]['resample'] = (item.waterQuality.resample).rstrip()
	resultDict[beachname]['insDate'] = (item.waterQuality.hash_rel.insdate).strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
	resultDict[beachname]['pdfDate'] = (item.waterQuality.hash_rel.pdfdate).strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
	resultDict[beachname]['GeomType'] = (records[i][-3]).split("ST_")[1]
	resultDict[beachname]['Lon'] = round(records[i][-2], 5)
	resultDict[beachname]['Lat'] = round(records[i][-1], 5)
	resultDict[beachname]['Name'] = (item.waterQuality.beach_rel.BeachName).rstrip()
featList = []
for key in resultDict.keys():
		# Point takes items as long, lat. Point must have (())
		beachPoint = Point((resultDict[key]['Lon'], resultDict[key]['Lat']))
		feature = Feature(geometry=beachPoint, properties=resultDict[key])
		featList.append(feature)

featCollect = FeatureCollection(featList)
</pre></code></div>

			<h3><a href=#leaflet>Leaflet</a></h3>
			<p>
				Finally, it’s time to display the data with a responsive web map. Loading and displaying the data in Leaflet with a legend and markers is relatively easy. The beach open status
				property is used to determine which icon to display for each beach and up-to-date beach details are available as pop-ups. To facilitate navigating through the beaches dataset, I
				used the <a href=https://www.github.com/stefanocudini/leaflet-search>Leaflet Search</a></span> plugin to enable auto-completion searching of beaches by name. I also included a modal that opens on page load, and is openable with a
				button, so users can read about the map and data limitations. The final step was to make the map mobile friendly. A viewport tag to size content down on mobile screens allows all content and pop-up information to be clearly visible and not in conflict with other map elements. JavaScript event listeners further reduce clutter by closing pop-ups and windows on user actions.

			<!-- <p> JavaScript Listeners:
				<pre><code class="javascript">
searchControl.on('search:locationfound', function(e) {
	if(e.layer._popup)
		e.layer.openPopup();

searchControl.on('search:expanded', function(e) {
	map.closePopup()
});
				</pre></code>

			<h2><a href=#final-thoughts>Final Thoughts</a></h2>
			<p>
			This was a fun project that allowed me to expand and refine many of my coding and web development skills while generating a product that’s useful for beach-goers. My next goal for this map is to add expandable graphs to the beach pop-up windows that show the histories of the respective test result along with the ability to download historic report PDFs served from a S3 bucket.
