				This Internal dashboard allows city management to view reports of illicit discharges into storm drains and waterbodies throughout the city. Management staffs are able to view the details of reports, overall number of reports, and any reports that are pending action. The dashboard pulls information generated by an internal illicit discharge reporting application created by another GIS team member.

				This map allows city staff to quickly lookup the subdivision index number of subdivisions throughout the city. This index number is used to find physical records stored within the City’s vault of records. I updated the map and dataset, which were roughly 15 years out of date, by adding newly created subdivisions to the City’s GIS system. I also imported the old MXD into ArcGIS Pro, corrected a number of typos and index errors in the original dataset, created an ArcGIS Feature Service, and incorporated the newly updated dataset into other maps.
