# Website and Projects

This repo contains all the source code for my Flask based website, found at [leavittmapping.com](https://leavittmapping.com).

All the code for my personal projects, which use open source resources, are included within this repo. Long form descriptions of these projects can be found on my [projects page](https://leavittmapping.com/#goto-proj). My professional projects are not included within this repo, however brief descriptions are available on my website.

I have tried by best to code cleanly and document code throughout the repo.
